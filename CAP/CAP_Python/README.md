# Color-Attenuation-Prior-Dehazing
## Introduction
This code is an implementation of the single image dehazing
algorithm proposed in the paper ["A Fast Single Image Haze Removal
Algorithm using Color Attenuation Prior"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7128396) by Qingsong Zhu, Jiaming Mai
and Ling Shao.

This code strongly refers to the [matlab version code](https://github.com/JiamingMai/Color-Attenuation-Prior-Dehazing) by JiamingMai
